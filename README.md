# corgivational-gen

A simple microsite to generate corgivational quotes, straight from corgear! Developed as a submission for CompSAt Learn2Dev 2020.

`/src` - contains markups, scripts, and styles that will be bundled at build.
`/public` - contains static assets that will be directly copied during build.

Remember to run `npm install` before first build!

Use `npm run dev` to run a dev server, use `npm run build` to build for production.
